    <h3>Why Harp?</h3><p>When I began researching static-site generators, I was looking for something that was easy to set up, easy to modify and, most importantly, easy to update and deploy. There is a wide variety of options, but I boiled the list down to two: <a href="http://assemble.io/">Assemble</a> and <a href="http://harpjs.com/">Harp</a>.</p>
<p>While I&#39;ll definitely check out Assemble for future projects, I ended up going with Harp as it seemed like a good fit for what I was trying to accomplish: a simple static site for my résumé, projects and articles that could be hosted on GitHub.</p>
<p>What sold me on Harp were its documentation and how easy it was to get a project up and running. Another nice feature is its built-in preprocessing of Markdown, EJS and Sass. With one command all your preprocessed files are compiled to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, ready to be hosted anywhere. Nice, very nice!</p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in finding out more about Harp, check out their <a href="http://harpjs.com/docs/">docs</a> or have a look at <a href="http://mattlambert.ca/blog/how-to-use-the-harp-js-static-site-generator/">this how-to article</a>.</p>
<h3>Automated Workflow</h3><p>In order to make development as painless as possible, I set up some <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> tasks and integrated <a href="http://www.browsersync.io/">Browsersync</a>. After sorting out some intial compiling issues, I was able to have Gulp automating the build process and Browsersync automatically reloading the browser when my files were changed. This made for a very smooth workflow during the development phase.</p>
<p>As I also wanted to host the site on GitHub pages, I figured it would be a good idea to automate the build and deploy tasks as well. By default, Harp compiles files into a &#39;www&#39; folder in the root of your project. However, GitHub pages expect the index.html file to be in the root directory, not in a sub-directory like &#39;www&#39;. This can easily be fixed, though, since Harp allows you to pass in source and destination options with the compile command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">harp compile src dist
</code></pre>
<p>This code snippet tells harp to preprocess and build all files found in my &#39;src&#39; directory and save the static-site assets in the &#39;dist&#39; directory.</p>
<p>With the development and build tasks set up, it was time to look at automating deployment to GitHub pages. With the Gulp plugin <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-gh-pages">gulp-gh-pages</a> this couldn&#39;t be any easier. All I needed to do was pipe the source directory (the &#39;dist&#39; folder in this case) into the plugin. When the deploy task is called, the plugin copies the files from this directory and pushes them to the gh-pages branch of the repository.</p>
<p>Once I had all the gulp tasks working, I added two scripts to the package.json file to simplify things:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">&quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;start&quot;: &quot;gulp&quot;,
    &quot;publish&quot;: &quot;gulp build &amp;&amp; gulp deploy&quot;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The first script <em>(npm start)</em> calls the default gulp task which spins up a server on port 3000, watches all the files in my &#39;src&#39; directory and automatically reloads the browser when any changes are made.</p>
<p>The second script <em>(npm run publish)</em> calls the gulp build task which compiles the entire site, then the gulp deploy task which copies all the files in the &#39;dist&#39; directory and pushes them to the gh-page branch of my repository. Pretty sweet, I have to say.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in checking out how I set up the tasks, here&#39;s a <a href="https://gist.github.com/N8-B/6281849968bd49d85cd1">gist</a> of the gulpfile used for this site.</p>
<h3>Styling and Typography</h3><p>I wanted the styling and layout of the site to be clean and mobile friendly. To help me accomplish this, I used <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> and <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/">Neat</a>, two excellent Sass libraries maintained by the good folks at <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">thoughbot</a>. I do like <a href="https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/">Stylus</a>, but I&#39;m still a big fan of Sass. I&#39;ve used the Bourbon and Neat libraries on several projects and it&#39;s a joy to work with on static sites like this.</p>
<p>As regards typography, I wanted to use a <em>sans-serif</em> and <em>serif</em> combination. After testing a few fonts, I decided to use Calluna designed by <a href="http://www.exljbris.com/">exljbris Font Foundry</a>. Not only is it a beautiful font, but it also has <em>sans-serif</em> and <em>serif</em> versions. <a href="http://www.exljbris.com/calluna.html">Calluna</a> is used for all body copy and <a href="http://www.exljbris.com/callunasans.html">Calluna Sans</a> for headings and tag lines. I find that it&#39;s hard to go wrong if you pair fonts from the same family made by the same designer.</p>
<h3>Source Code</h3><p>All of the source code for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/N8-B/nathanburkiewicz.com">here</a> on GitHub. Feel free to take a look at how I organized the directories and set up the Gulp tasks.</p>
<p>The compiled files that are running this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/N8-B/nathanburkiewicz.com/tree/gh-pages">here</a> in the gh-pages branch of the repository.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve found that Harp, together with the power of Gulp, makes for a really nice developer experience. If you&#39;re looking for a no-fuss static-site generator for a personal site or a quick prototype, definitely take a look at Harp.</p>
<p>If you have any questions on my Harp-Gulp setup, please get in touch. I&#39;d be happy to help you out.</p>
